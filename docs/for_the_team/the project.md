THE PROJECT

As the joke goes there's two sorts of people in the world, those who agree that everyone can be divided into two 
sorts of people and those who don't.

Bones considers two sorts of people - people and programmers. Bones is designed to help people analyse data and 
to help programmers help people do that.

Many (most?) languages are written by programmers for programmers and as such, here, we're often not particularly 
interested in language features that excite programmers. Instead, although we still want bones to be powerful, Iwewant 
it in a  way that is clear and simple and most importantly accessible to people.

Much of bones has been very carefully thought through and currently it is at the stage of fleshing out those 
thoughts and testing those thoughts to destruction. We are at a point of execution and testing rather than 
blue sky thinking.
