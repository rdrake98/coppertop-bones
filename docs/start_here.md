people vs programmers

business scripting is the activity that people (and some programmers) do when they want to use a computer for business
analysis

business can be running a pub, playing with a physic simulation, running an algo desk, writing a minecraft mod

bones is designed to be a scripting language for end-users

I am principally a business scripter and incidentally a programmer - my programing activities are to enhance  
business scripting capabilities for myself or others, i.e. I'm neither a systems nor an application programmer, but 
nonetheless reasonably accomplished - plotting, message oriented middleware, timeseries MM file caching, higher 
performance malloc, excel and python interfaces, piping operator, algebraic type system, quant libraries, etc in 
C++, D, Java, C, Python. More recently I designed and implemented bones.
